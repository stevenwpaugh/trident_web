<h2>Welcome!</h2>
Trident is a genomics interaction web service designed to present results from genome wide associations studies with a variety of pharmacogenomic phenotypes incorporating network analysis between different genomic measurements. MicroRNA:dsDNA binding site data is generated using our novel heuristic search algorithm that predicts Hoogsteen-type base pairings. Predicted results are correlated with <i>in vitro</i> data from primary patient samples.
